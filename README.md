# Customer_Credit_Card_Usage_Analysis

Segmentation in marketing is a technique used to divide customers or other entities into groups based on attributes such as behaviour or demographics. It is useful to identify segments of customers who may respond in a similar way to specific marketing techniques such as email subject lines or display advertisements. As it gives businesses the ability to tailor marketing messages and timing to generate better response rates and provide improved consumer experiences.

In this project, we are going to use a dataset containing a number of behavioural attributes for credit card customers. We will develope a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy leveraging clustering. We will be using the scikit-learn python machine learning library to apply an unsupervised machine learning technique known as clustering to identify segments that may not immediately be apparent to human cognition.

The sample dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. The dataset consists of 18 features about the behaviour of credit card customers. These include variables such as the balance currently on the card, the number of purchases that have been made on the account, the credit limit, and many others.
